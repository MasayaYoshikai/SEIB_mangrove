# SEIB-DGVM for mangroves

This is a modified code of the **SEIB-DGVM version 2.81** for simulating mangrove growth under salinity stress.  
The code was bulit on the one from <https://github.com/NakamuraTakashi/SEIB-DGVM> by Dr. Takashi Nakamura who made some modifications to the original code.  
This modified code uses STPK Library (<http://www.gfd-dennou.org/library/davis/stpk/index.htm.en>).

The model is described in:  
Yoshikai, M., Nakamura, T., Suwa, R., Sharma, S., Rollon, R., Yasuoka, J., Egawa, R., and Nadaoka, K.: Predicting mangrove forest dynamics across a soil salinity gradient using an individual-based vegetation model linked with plant hydraulics, Biogeosciences, 19, 1813â€“1832, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1813-2022, 2022.
