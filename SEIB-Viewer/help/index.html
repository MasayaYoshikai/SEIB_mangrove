<H2>
What's SEIB-Viewer?
</H2>
<p>
SEIB-Viewer provides easy way to show and analyze simulation results of SEIB-DGVM (Station version). SEIB-Viewer is a strong tool for comprehensive understanding what happened in a simulation run.
</p>


<H2>
How to use
</H2>
<p>
SEIB-Viewer requires Windows-XP. Memory requirement depends on lengh of simulation years. The versions of SEIB-viewer and SEIB-DGVM code should be properly corresponded with each other.
</p>
<p>
After running the program, open a result file 'output.txt' from file menu. When reading and analysis of the specified file were completed, SEIB-Viewer displays simulation results. By changing time-slider and time-range rudio-button, users can change year and year range to show.
</p>
<p>
To display physiognomy, users have to prepare jpeg images using POV-RAY code (distributing with SEIB code) for each simuation year. These image files should be at the same folder of 'output.txt', and file name should be 'Viewer_animation???.jpg', where '???' is a successive year number starting from '001'.

<H2>
Display items
</H2>



<H3>
Tab1 (Information)
</H3>
<center><IMG SRC="SV1.jpg" BORDER=0></center>
<p>
This tab displays simulation settings. Latitude and londitude are written in decimal system after decimal point. For latitude, plus and minus values indicate north and south, respectively. For longitude, plus and minus values indicate east and west, respectively.
</p>


<H3>
Tab2 (Climate)
</H3>
<center><IMG SRC="SV2.jpg" BORDER=0></center>
<p>
This tab displays climate data that was inputted for the simulation. When time range is '1yr', graphs show daily values except for precipitation (monthly sum). When time range is '5yrs', graphs show monthly means (monthly sum for precipitation). When time range is '50yrs', graphs show annual means (annual sum for precipitation).
</p>



<H3>
Tab3 (Radiation)
</H3>
<center><IMG SRC="SV3.jpg" BORDER=0></center>
<p>
This tab displays radiation properties in the simulation. 'Radiation at midday' and 'PAR at midday' are stacked graphs. 'Attenuation factor' indicates unabsorbed fraction of radiation after passing through woody and grass layers. When time range is '1yr', it shows daily values. When time range is '5yrs', graphs show monthly means. When time range is '50yrs', graphs show annual means.
</p>



<H3>
Tab4 (Material cycles)
</H3>
<center><IMG SRC="SV4.jpg" BORDER=0></center>
<p>
This tab displays carbon and water balances, which are linked with plant dynamics in SEIB-DGVM. 'Water flux' is showen by stacked graph. In 'Water strage', soil water contents are indicated as a fraction of field capacity. Soil water above and below wilting point are colored by pale blue and pale pink, respectively. When time range is '1yr' and '5yrs', graphs show monthly sums (fluxes) or means (strages). When time range is '50yrs', graphs show annual sums (fluxes) or means (strages).
</p>



<H3>
Tab5 (Plant Properties)
</H3>
<center><IMG SRC="SV5.jpg" BORDER=0></center>
<p>
This tab displayes plant properties. 'Allocation' is showen by stacked graph. Size class distibution' shows histogram of tree-size-class, which is determined by trunk diameter. When time range is '1yr' and '5yrs', graphs show monthly means (except for 'Size class distribution'). When time range is '50yrs', graphs show annual means.
</p>



<H3>
Tab6 (Physiognomy)
</H3>
<center><IMG SRC="SV6.jpg" BORDER=0></center>
<p>
This tab displays physiognomy of each simulation year. Grass PFTs are not visualized.
</p>




<H2>
Known problem
</H2>
<P>
When 'Physiognomy' tab was selected, 'Play/Stop' button does not function.
</P>
