+Sample climatic data to run the model (@Folder "code")
Climate_Pasoh(1901_2013).txt
Sample climate data for inputting the SEIB-DGVM. This data was generated by the climatic data generator on the SEIB-DGVM website by specifying latitude N 2'58, longitude E 102'18, and years 1901~2013. This locations corresponds to Pasoh experimantal forest in Malaysia.

+ Location data for inputting SEIB-DGVM (@Folder "code")
land_prop.txt     Global location data at 1 degree grid mesh. Each line corresponds to one grid mesh: the sequence is N90W180 -> N90W179 -> ... N89W180 -> ... -> S90E180. Data sequence for each line is : Land Mask (sea:0, Land:1), Elevation (m), Soil albedo, Saturation point, field capacity, Matrix potential, Wilting point. This file was generated from 'Input Data' of Global Soil Wetness Project 2 (http://grads.iges.org/gswp/)

+SEIB-Viewer (@Folder "SEIB-Viewer")
This is a GUI based program for browsing simulation result. Further explanation can be found on the lower part of this manuscript.

+MPI comuputation package (@Folder "code/mpi_package")
This package enables the SEIB-DGVM to compute multigrid cells by using MPI parallel computation. It also contains a R code for visualizing result of the multi-grid simulation. For further explanation about this package, refer readme.mpi.txt in this folder.

+++++++++ Procedure of simulation (from bare ground) +++++++++
(1) Set location to simulate
Find following lines in the star_point.f90
  LAT     =  2.97 !north:+, south:- (decimalized)
  LON     = 102.3 ! east:+,  west:- (decimalized)
Then, set the variables LAT and LON to latitude and longitude, respectively. Range of latitude must be within -90.0 to 90.0 (-:south, +:north). Range of longitude must be within from -180 to +180 (-:west, +:east). Note, we used decadal system after decimal point.

(2) Modify parameter values in modules.f90 file, if necessary
This file contains setting values for simulation, such as maximum individual number in a plot, maximum height of forest stand, and whether output each procedure log to a file. For more descripition, read comments on the file.

(3) Specify how atmospheric CO2 concentration changes during simulations (Optional)
The default code simulates assuming that atmospheric CO2 concentration is fixed at 368.0 ppm. To employ the historical record or IPCC RCPs, activate the following comment line, which is available in the main.f90.
   !co2atm = aco2_annual(max(year_climate+51, YearMaxCO2))  !Same as year_climate

(3) Make run file
In start_point.f90, all code files are designated by "Include" command. Thus, by compiling start_point.f90, all Fortran files will be automatically complied into a run file. Specifically, when name of executable file is specified as 'go.out', type following sentences from command line.
   f90 start_point.f90 -o go.out
The compile command ('f90' in the above example) depends on compiler; 'ifort' for Intel compiler and 'g95' for g95 Fortran compiler.

(4) Set parameter setting file, parameter.txt
See lower paragraph below for definitions of each parameter. At least, following two values should be modified; (a) simulation year, (b) full path directory of climate data and soil data. Note that paramter.txt should be placed at the same directory of execution file.

(5) Execute program
Type executable file name (go.out in case of the previous example) from command line. Then, several output files will be made at the same folder of this execution file.

(6) After confirming above procedure, replace climate data with data of your designated location and year. You can make it online at our web-site.


+++++++++ Procedure of simulation (from restart file) +++++++++
(1) Prepare restart file
Set a parameter 'Flag_spinup_write' in parameter.txt to ".true.". Then execute run as was mentioned before. After simulation, a restart-data-file 'spinup_out.txt' will be generated on the same directory of the execution file.

(2) Restart run
Set a parameter 'Flag_spinup_read' in parameter.txt to ".true.". Rename 'spinup_out.txt' to 'spinup_in.txt'. This file should be placed at the same directory of execution file. Then execute program as was mentioned before. Restarted simulation will be conducted for year that is specified by "Simulation_year".


+++++++++ Parameter Setting +++++++++
At the beginning of simulation run, the program read setting file (parameter.txt), then initialize the simulation condition as was specified on it. Parameters in the setting file are grouped into 10 'name lists'. Here, I will only explain parameters within 'control' name list. Definition of other parameters can be found in Sato et al. (2007). Additional explanations are also available on the module.f90. Parameters that start from "Flag_" are switches, which must be specified '.true.' or '.false.' for ON or OFF, respectively.

Simulation_year --->
Simulation year

Flag_spinup_read --->
On: starts from spin up file, Off: starts from bare ground

Flag_spinup_write --->
On: write restart file

Flag_output_write --->
On: write output files

Flag_randomization --->
On: each simulation-run can refer unique random table

Max_loc --->
One side length of virtual forest (m)

Depth --->
Depth of one soil layer (mm)

STEP --->
Vertical resolution for computation (m). This parameter determines vertical steps of crown disk height and bole height.

C_in_drymass --->
Proportion of carbon mass in dry biomass (around 0.5).

File_no --->
Devise number allocated for each output file. Avoid overlapping.

Fn_climate --->
File path for local climatic data (daily data).

Fn_CO2 --->
File path for atmospheric CO2 concentration data (annual data).

Fn_location --->
File path for global location/soil data. Seven paths should be specified for the following order: Land ocean mask, Altitude, Albedo, Field capacity, Saturation point, Matrix potential, Wilting point.

Fn_spnin  --->
File path for spinup input data.

Fn_spnout --->
File path for spinup output data.


+++++++++ SEIB-Viewer +++++++++
SEIB-Viewer is a MS-Windows application, which visualizes simulation output of SEIB-DGVM. SEIB-Viewer does not require install procedure, and it does not modify registry. Thus, you can place folder "SEIB-Viewer" on any directory. To run SEIB-Viewer, just double click SEIB-Viewer.exe in the folder. Further explanations of this software can be found in help file that can be accessed from the application.
